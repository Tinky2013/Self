    <h3>RESEARCH INTEREST </h3>
    <p>
        I'm really interested in the interdisciplinary field of <strong>Statistics and Computer Science </strong> and I hope to develop towards the field of <strong>data science </strong>.
        My research interests broadly include topics in statistics, machine learning and algorithms, 
        such as bayesian statistics, time series analysis, optimization, data mining, 
        variational inference, stochastic process, machine learning theory and so on.

    <h3>SKILLS AND HOBBIES</h3>
    <p>I'm not a typical tech geek. In addition to exploring algorithm and coding, I am interested in a wide range of disciplines 
        such as sociology, applied psychology, finance, astronomy, anthropology, poetry, geophysics, business administration and so on. </p>

    <p>I especially like to get in touch with all kinds of people, so be free to contact me (by email <strong>wuziyue@zju.edu.cn</strong>
        or wechat <strong>Tinky11131998</strong>). My hobbies include many kinds of sports such as swimming, biking, soccer and so on. Also,
        I especially like to go traveling, hiking or sharing all kinds of experiences with other people. Meanwhile, some sorts of musical instruments and photography are also my cup of tea.</p>
